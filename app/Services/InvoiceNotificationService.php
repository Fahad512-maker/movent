     * status 'draft', so notifying at creation time would hand the client a link
     * that 404s. Callers therefore only call this on the draft → sent
     * transition; re-sending an already-sent invoice goes out by email alone
     * rather than stacking a second portal row for the same invoice.

     * to write to: an invoice raised against a lead only, a guest / external
     * customer with no client record, a client whose portal access is off, or a
     * client whose portal doesn't surface Invoices at all.
